Hello everyone,
This is the 24th day of the 100DaysOfCode Challenge.
I wanna talk about some long term goals now. Long terms as in 2-3 months.
I wanna learn node make some projects with it, learn tailwind and make the future projets using it, cause it saves a lot of time I've heard.
and I'm looking forward to the MERN stack. Someone suggested that It'll be good for me. I have to complete the 2 multi page websites from frontend mentor. 
I also want to work with a whole lot of apis cause I'm not good with them. So making some mini projects such as weather app, something related to country app.
Now, talking about what I did today, I practiced node, worked on the dine-restaurant-website. Also worked on the athyca-website a bit.
This was all for today. Byee :)
