Hello everyone, 
This is the fifth day of the 100DaysOfCode challenge.
My goal for today was to complete the calculator and the website and I had not achived it.
Till now I've made the standard calculator. I have to add the currency converter, length converter, temperature converter etc.
My goals for tomorrow are to complete one of these and to complete the website and practice reactQuery.
