Hello everyone,
This is the 27th day of the 100DaysOfCode Challenge. Today I worked on the athyca website and the photosnap-multi-page-website. As you know that the photosnap-website is my first website with tailwind. I think that I'm getting better in using tailwind. I mean I'm kind of now remembering the styles of tailwind. After completing the photosnap-multi-page-website I want to make another multi-page website. And after that I want to make some projects that include logic, I mean the invoice challenge of frontend mentor is a good example for this. So after another multi-page-website I want to make something like the invoice app.
But, I also want to learn node. So, that means that I can only do 1 thing at one time. I might focus on node and python after creating another multi-page-website. :)
