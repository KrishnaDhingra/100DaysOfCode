Hello everyone,
THis is the fourtheenth day of the 100DaysOfCode Challenge.
My goals for today were to practice React Hooks and work on a mini project.
Today I learn some new hooks ( useContext, useMemo, useCallback).
I start making a mini shopping Cart app with react. 
I'm thinking of merging the menu sorter and the read more function with which you can expand and contract the text.
My goals for tomorrow are to practice React Hooks and work on the mini Shopping Cart app. :)
