Hello everyone,
This is the 43rd day of the 100daysofcode challenge. Actually I might have completed the challenge cause I didn't made a file of every day. But anyway, It's been quite some time since I coded. Around 2 weeks or so. I did practice typescript and node js. Actually not pracited typescript but learned it :). Today I worked on the portfolio-website. Made the detailed work component. I do have to code the mobile design though. But it felt very refreshing and good to code after this long. Yaar exams were going on aur abhi phir se start ho gye. Now talking about what I want to do, I want to complete the portfolio website asap. And 3 projects pending hai abhi. Ek to the rest countries api one. The just have to make it responsive, second the e-commerce website, usme I have to add the cart feature aur checkout feature. It'll take some time. And the third one is the invoice-app. Yaar I can't figure out how to add new invoice. So, right now I'll try to or I have to focus on my exams. Bich mai thoda thoda code karte rahunga agar man kara to. :) Byeeee.
