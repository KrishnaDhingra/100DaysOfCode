Hello everyone,
This is the eighteenth day of the 100DaysofCode Challenge.
Today I started learning bootstrap and did quite a bit of it.
I also started making a website. But the sad part is that I didn't worked on the e-commerce site. 
I also have to start making my portfolio website. 
So my goals for tomorrow are to complete the new website and work on the e-commerce site a bit.
and I'm also thinking of writing some long term goals. I mean not long term long term but for around a week or so.
So I'm thiking of completing the new website, the e-commerce website and start working on the portfolio website. :)
