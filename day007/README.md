Hello everyone,
This is the seventh day of the 100DaysOfCode Challenge.
Today I started with a Country-finder-app with html, css and js.
I first started with the basic implementation of the app. The filter by search part is almost done.
The filter by region part is left and designing is left.
I also practised reactQuery today.
My goals for tomorrow are to complete the Country-finder-app and practice reactQuery.
