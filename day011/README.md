Hello everyone,
This is the eleventh day of the 100DayofCode Challenge.
My goals for today were to add the Length Converter feature in the Calculator, complete the Tech Dudes Website and practice React Hooks. I wasn't able to complete all of them but I did complete the Tech Dudes Website and Practice React Hooks. 
I won't be able to code a lot for a few days as my exams are approaching and therefore I'll have to reduce the number of goals I set for the next day.
