Hello everyone,
This is the sixth day of the 100dayofcode challenge.
I didn't work on the calculator or the website but I did practice a lot of react query.
I learnt about getQuerydata, cacheTime, staleTime, setQuerydata. For a few days from now I'll just be practicing react and will be making some mini projects using react.
