Hello everyon,
This is the 38th day of the 100daysofcode challenge. 
In these 2 days I practice node js, worked on the invoice app and finally did quite a bit of work on the audiophile-e-commerce-website. My goals for tomorrow are to start working on the cart function in the audiophile-e-commerce-website and work a bit on the invoice-app and practice some basic node js if possible.
