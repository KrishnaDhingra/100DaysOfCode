This is the first day of the 100daysofcode challenge.
Today I started working on a Guess the Color game using Html, Css and Js.
Link to the project - https://krishnadhingra.github.io/100DaysOfCode/day1/guess_%20the_color/
All the things have been done except for the styling part ( will do that tomorrow).
I also started learning Material Ui.
My goals for tomorrow is to complete the Guess the Color game and practice Material Ui.
