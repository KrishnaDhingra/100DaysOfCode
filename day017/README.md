Hello everyone,
This is the 17th day of the 100DaysofCode Challenge.
I know that it's been a very very long time since I updated you.
I don't know why but I was very demotivated. Now forgetting what mistakes I did in the past I started working on the e-commerce website quite a while back. I working on the showcase componenent and the showcase header today.
My goals for today are to work on the product detail component which will give all the essential information about a specific product. I'll also try to work on the cart.
