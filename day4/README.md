Hello everyone,

This is the fourth day of the 100DaysOfCodeChallenge.
Today I started making a website which is almost done. I also started working on an all in one calculator (which will be able to convert temperatures, different units, do calculations etc).

My goals for tomorrow are to complete the website and the calculator and practice react query.
