Hello everyone,
This is the 25th day of the 100DaysOfCode Challenge.
Actually not the 25th, I missed a lot of days.
I did a lot of things i the past few days. I worked in the hackathon, I started making a multi page website. I learned tailwind, practiced ml. Right now, my goal is to just complete the photosnap multi-page website.
