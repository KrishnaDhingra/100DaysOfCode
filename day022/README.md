Hello everyone,
This is the twenty-frist day of the 100DaysofCode Challenge.
Today I worked a bit on the athyca website.
I also started making a googke keep clone.
So now I have to make a whole lot of projects.
The athyca website, portfolio website, google keep clone, complete the dine restaurant website. 
I know that this is not a good thing to work on a bunch of projects at once.
But as I have started with them. I'll try my best to complete them as soon as possible. :)
