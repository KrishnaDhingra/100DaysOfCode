# 100DaysOfCode
Hello everyone,
In these 100 days my goals are to make a whole bunch of projects and learn new technologies.

I'll be updating you'll everyday by telling that what did I code today, what new project I started with or what things I learn.

Rules of the challenge:
I have to code aleast for an hour everyday.
