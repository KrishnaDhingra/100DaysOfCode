Hello everyone,
This is the 42nd day of the 100daysofcode challenge. 
Today I started learning typescript and finished most of it. 
From now onwards I'll use typescript with react and I also have to learn next. 
So next js might replace react but I'll also use typescript with it.
After all of this, there are three main things I  have to focus on.
Study, Node and Python. 
Let's hope for the best :)
