Hello everyone,
This is the 26th day of the 100DaysOfCode Challenge.
Today I worked on the photosnap multi page website.
I think that working with tailwind is taking some extra time right now. But I think that after some time it will be really beneficial.
In some time I'll have to figure out a way to work with tailwind. It might be styled components + tailwind. Let's see.
I also have to pracitce node and python. I think that ml will be really beneficial in the future. So, I'll have to start praticing ml also. :)
