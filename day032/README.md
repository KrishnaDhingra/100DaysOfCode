Hello everyone,
This is the 32nd day of the 100daysofcode challenge. Today I practiced node js and framer motion. I'll be making some micro-animations with framer motion to practice what I've done. I also have to pracitce apis and make some mini projects using it from frontend mentor. 
My goals for tomorrow are to make some micro animations and, practice some node js and apis. :)
