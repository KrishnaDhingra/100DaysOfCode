Hello everyone,
This is the 30th day of the 100DaysOfCode Challenge. Today I worked just a bit on the photosnap-multi-page-website ( that is now finally complete ). I also worked a bit on the athyca-website. I also practiced node as I thought it's been quite long. I also started with framer motion. I started watching around a 1.3 hours tutorial for framer motion. I think that I'll finish it today. So, my goals for tomorrow are to finish the framer motion tutorial, practice node and start with the frontend mentor country api project. I think that I'm really bad with apis. So, for the next week or two. I'll work on some mini projects in which I'll work with apis. I'll practice node and start with a frontend mentor multi page website. :)
