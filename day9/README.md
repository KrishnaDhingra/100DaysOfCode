Hello everyone,
This is the ninth day of the 100DaysOfCode Challenge.
My goal was to either work on the all-in-one-calculator or on the api app and I chose the all-in-one-calculator.
I added the temperature converter feature and I also worked on the tech dudes website ( changed the colors a bit, made it reponsive etc). I also pracitce a bit of new react hooks today.
My goals for tomorrow are to add the currency converter feature in the calculator, complete the tech dudes website and pracitce React Hooks.
