Hello everyone,

This is the fourth day of the 100DaysOfCodeChallenge.
Today I started making a website which is almost done. I also started working on an all in one calculator (which will be able to convert temperatures, different units, do calculations etc).
Link to the project - https://krishnadhingra.github.io/100DaysOfCode/day4/tech_dudes_website/

My goals for tomorrow are to complete the website and the calculator and practice react query.
