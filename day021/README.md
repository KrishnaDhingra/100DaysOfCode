Hello everyone,
This is the twentieth day of the 100DaysOfCode Challenge.
Today I started with a sort of a mini project. A dine restaurant single page website.
I'm thinking of making 2 or 3 these kinds of websites. 1 every day.
Let's see how it goes. Now talking about my long term goals ( For the next 2 months or so ).
I think that I've done enough of frontend. I also wanted to learn next js, tailwind, sass. But surely I can learn all of them afterwards. I'm thinking of starting with node js work backend and I'll continue making frontend projects. As I told you a few days back that I wanted to make atleast 5 big projects from frontend mentor. And also my exams are starting from 4th of september so I might code a bit less than usual. :)
