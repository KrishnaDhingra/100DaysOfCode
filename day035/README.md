Hello everyone,
This is the 35th day of the 100dayofcode challenge. Today I worked on the countries-of-the-world project. I also practiced a bit of react query.
My goal for tomorrow is to finish the countries-of-the-world project and practice react query, work on the athyca-website and learn about some new hooks. Like useLocation, useHistory etc..
