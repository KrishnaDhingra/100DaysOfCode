Hello everyone,
This is the 28th day of the 100DaysofCode Challenge.
A funny thing happened with me today. I remember commiting the 27th day's file. I opened github saw that the last commit was 3 days ago. Now what happended is that I was pushing the file but my internet wasn't working then. So...., I hope you get it.
Now today, I worked on the athyca website and the photosnap-multi-page-website. I'll complete the photosnap-multi-page-website by tomorrow I think. After completing it I'll start with another multi-page-website. :)
