Hello everyone,
This is the tenth day of the 100DaysOfCode Challenge.
My goals were to complete the currency converter, complete the Tech Dudes Website and practice react Hooks.
I completed the currency converter, I also practiced react Hooks but I wasn't able to complete the Tech Dudes Website.
My goals for tomorrow are to add the Length Converter feature in the Calculator and also the shifting feature, complete the Tech Dudes Website and practice react Hooks
