Hello everyone,
This is the ninteenth day of the 100DaysOfCode Challenge.
Today I completed work page of my portfolio-website and I also added the functionality of react router. Now people can change pages. Now I just have to complete the navbar, about page and do I bit of work on the home page. I also practice a bit of bootstrap today.
My goals for tomorrow are to work on the athyca website and the e-commerc website. Right now I'll stop working on the portfolio-website a bit a concentrate on some projects.I wanna make a whole lot of projects in the coming two years. Atleast 5 big projects from frontend mentor. :)
